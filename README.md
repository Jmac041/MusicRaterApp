# FaveTune: MusicRaterApp
Jackson and Naomy's second homework assignment for COMP333: a music rater app called FaveTune. Work Split: 50/50

## How it Works
When opening the site, users are directed to log in, with a link to sign up if they don't have an account. If they create a new account, their username and password are stored in a database (with the password hashed) and they are directed to login. After logging in, users are directed to the index page displaying all of the song ratings in the database. There, they may create a new song rating, updating one of their existing song ratings, delete one of their existing song ratings, or view either one of their ratings or another person's rating. Each one of these actions directs them to a different page, and at each one users have the option to return back to the ratings or log out. When creating a new song, users are prompted to add the artist name, song name, and their rating from 1 to 5 (or they may cancel the rating, redirecting them to the index page). The rating is stored in the database along with their username attached to it. View, update, and delete alter ratings in the database.
